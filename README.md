## Demonstration of some swagger-codegen issues

### Default methods on `spring-cloud` interfaces

Feign will execute any default methods on an interface rather than initiating any HTTP call.
This conflicts with the interface generated by the `swagger-codegen-maven-plugin` which always
come with a default method on Java 8.

### `useBeanValidation` ignored

`useBeanValidation` is set to false in the `pom.xml` yet the dependency is required.
To demonstrate this issue, remove the `validation-api` dependency and run `mvn clean compile`.

### Unnecessary dependency on `spring-cloud-security` and `spring-security-oauth2`

The generated `ClientConfiguration` class always contains imports for
`org.springframework.cloud.security` and `org.springframework.security.oauth2`, even though
they aren't used in the class. To see the issue, remove the line `**/ClientConfiguration.java`
from the `.swagger-codegen-ignore` file and run `mvn clean compile`.
